Currently I am a PhD student studying machine learning involving quantum systems at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">Institute for Quantum Computing</a>. I am supervised by Achim Kempf (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-of-information-lab/">Physics of Information Lab</a>).

Since 2021 I have studied theory of quantum machine learning. At Xanadu I interned with Maria Schuld to characterize strange generalization behavior in quantum models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05523">2209.05523</a>), and separately looked at how bandwidth affects quantum kernel models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06686">2206.06686</a>).

In 2019-2021 I was a visiting researcher at Fermilab where I worked on near-term implementations of quantum circuits. I implemented a quantum machine learning model on Google's Sycamore quantum computer (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00498-9">npj quantum</a>), studied efficient readout error mitigation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08161">2105.08161</a>), demonstrated how to use better qubits on hardware (PRX Quantum, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00445">2201.00445</a>), and simulated noise models for quantum simulation on near-term devices (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9651438">IEEE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02396">2111.02396</a>).

During 2018-2019 I worked with the original team of UWaterloo students to prototype/develop the software library that eventually became <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum">TensorFlow Quantum</a>.

During 2017-2018 I worked on design and fabrication of superconducting qubits.
