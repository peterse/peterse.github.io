Currently I am a PhD student studying machine learning involving quantum systems at the Institute for Quantum Computing (University of Waterloo).

In 2019-2021 I was a visiting researcher at Fermilab where I worked on near-term implementations of quantum circuits. I studied machine learning using quantum computers (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00498-9">npj quantum</a>), efficient readout error mitigation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08161">2105.08161</a>), how to use better qubits on hardware (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00445">2201.00445</a>), and noise models for quantum simulation on near-term hardware (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9651438">IEEE</a>).

During 2018-2019 I worked with the original team of UWaterloo students to prototype/develop the software library eventually became <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum">TensorFlow Quantum</a>.

During 2017-2018 I worked on design and fabrication of superconducting qubits.
